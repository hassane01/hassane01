# Hi there! 👋 I'm Hassane 

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a front-end developer specializing in React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and Tailwind CSS.

- 🔥 I've been enjoying front-end development ever since I built my first React project. Bringing designs to life with React and Tailwind has made me love the creative side of development. I'm currently looking for a role in front-end development where I can continue building dynamic, responsive web applications. I'd love to work on a collaborative team where I can contribute quickly. If you're hiring, let's connect!

- 🛠️ I'm passionate about web development and creating responsive, user-friendly interfaces.
